# 🏦 The Smart-Lender Micro-Credit Risk Engine

A predictive analytics solution designed to assess the default risk of micro-loan applicants for FinTech lenders, ensuring regulatory compliance through model explainability.

## 1. 💡 Business Problem & Solution

#### The Problem:
Traditional credit scoring methods often fail to predict default for micro-loans accurately, leading to excessive financial loss (False Negatives: approving applicants who default).

#### The Solution:
This project deploys a robust **XGBoost Classifier** optimized for **Recall** (catching defaulters). Critically, it integrates **SHAP values** to provide clear "reason codes" for every decision, supporting regulatory compliance and building trust with Loan Officers.

## 2. 🎯 Key Technical & Financial Achievements

| Achievement | Technical Rationale | Financial Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **High Recall Optimization** | Used `scale_pos_weight` in XGBoost to penalize False Negatives heavily due to high cost. | Minimizes the most expensive error: preventing direct **principal loss** from defaults. |
| **Model Explainability** | Integrated **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** to break down predictions. | Ensures **regulatory compliance** by providing applicants with clear reasons for rejection (e.g., "High DTI"). |
| **Full Pipeline Deployment** | Used Streamlit to deploy the trained model as an interactive dashboard. | Delivers an actionable tool to the end-user (the Loan Officer) immediately. |

## 3. ⚙️ Project Execution Steps

The project follows a standard Data Science lifecycle:

1.  **Data Acquisition & EDA:** Synthetic data is generated, simulating the **class imbalance** (90% Paid vs. 10% Default) inherent in lending data.
2.  **Feature Engineering:** Calculated financial ratios (like DTI) are used as primary features.
3.  **Modeling:** XGBoost is trained, focusing on the appropriate metric for loss prevention (**Recall**).
4.  **Deployment:** The trained model is saved and integrated into a Streamlit UI for interaction.

## 4. ▶️ How to Run Locally

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/bulidere]
    cd smart-lender-risk-engine
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Train the Model:** (This generates data, trains the model, and saves `credit_risk_model.pkl`).
    ```bash
    python model_build.py
    ```
4.  **Run the Dashboard:** (This opens the interactive app in your browser.)
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```
